## Description
This app will be a replica of Mario, or the lite version of the early Mario Games. The game will
be designed with an initial Welcome Screen, a Menu for navigation, as well of several stages to
choose from. Within the game, the player will be able to control 2D characters, in an
environment similar to Mario World.
